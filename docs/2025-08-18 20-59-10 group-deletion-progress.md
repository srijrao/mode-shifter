# Group zip/unzip deletion progress — implementation log

Date-Time: 2025-08-18 20-59-10

## Goal
Include deletion steps in progress when:
- Zipping groups: deletion of original files (deleteOriginals) and optional original folders.
- Unzipping groups: deletion of the archive file when configured.

## Plan
1) Archive-level progress
   - Extend createArchive to count deletion of originals in the same onProgress stream.
   - Compute total = files read + files deleted (when deleteOriginals=true).
   - Emit phase-specific messages: "Zipping ..." and "Deleting originals ...".
2) Group zip flows (main.ts)
   - Wrap onProgress to add extra steps for deleting the original folder(s).
   - Delay setComplete until folder deletions finish; show deletion progress per folder.
3) Group unzip flows (main.ts)
   - Wrap restore progress to reserve one extra step if deleteArchiveAfterRestore is true.
   - After restore completes, advance progress for "Deleting archive..." before setComplete.
4) Tests & validation
   - Run existing test suite to ensure no regressions.
   - Manually sanity-check progress math with small scenarios.

## Viability check
- Changes are backward compatible: onProgress remains optional; messages are additive.
- createArchive internals already manage deletion; threading a progress callback is low-risk.
- main.ts controls the UI modal; adding a couple of progress updates around deletions is safe.
- No external APIs changed; only internal type tweaks in CreateArchiveOptions.

## Execution log
- 20:59:10 — Created implementation plan and verified approach is compatible.
- 21:02:00 — Implemented deletion progress hooks in `src/archive.ts` (onPhaseMessage, onDeleteProgress) and wired UI updates in `main.ts` for zip/unzip flows.
- 21:02:05 — Built and ran tests: 61 passed, 0 failed. Progress math remains consistent; no API breakages.
- 21:03:23 — Cleaned up VS Code tasks; fixed date-time task to use `Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss`.
