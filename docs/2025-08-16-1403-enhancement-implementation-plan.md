# Mode Shifter Enhancement Implementation Plan
*Created: 2025-08-16 14:03:50*

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan to address user feedback for the Mode Shifter plugin, including detailed steps, viability assessment, and progress tracking.

## User Feedback Analysis

Based on the user feedback from `2025-08-16 User Feedback.md`, we need to address four main issues:

1. **Progress Indication & Cancellation**: Users want progress indicators and the ability to cancel long-running operations
2. **Folder Deletion vs Renaming**: Users prefer folder deletion over renaming fallbacks to preserve links and plugin compatibility
3. **Right-Click Context Menu**: Users want right-click options in the file explorer for quick zip/unzip operations
4. **Temporary File Cleanup**: Users want a setting to clean up orphaned temporary files

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Progress Indication & Cancellation Support

#### 1.1 Create Progress Modal Component
- **Objective**: Add a modal that shows operation progress with cancel capability
- **Files to modify**: `main.ts`, new file `src/progress-modal.ts`
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a new `ProgressModal` class extending Obsidian's `Modal`
  - Add progress bar, status text, and cancel button
  - Implement cancellation token pattern for async operations
  - Update `createArchive` and `restoreArchive` to support progress callbacks

#### 1.2 Enhance Archive Operations with Progress
- **Objective**: Modify archive operations to report progress
- **Files to modify**: `src/archive.ts`
- **Implementation**:
  - Add progress callback parameters to `createArchive` and `restoreArchive`
  - Implement file-by-file progress reporting
  - Add cancellation token support to abort operations

### Phase 2: Improved Folder Management

#### 2.1 Remove Renaming Fallback
- **Objective**: Ensure folders are properly deleted without renaming fallbacks
- **Files to modify**: `main.ts`, `src/utils.ts`
- **Implementation**:
  - Review and improve `deleteFolderSafely` function
  - Remove any renaming fallback mechanisms
  - Add better error handling for deletion failures
  - Ensure folder structure preservation when deletion fails

### Phase 3: Context Menu Integration

#### 3.1 Add File Explorer Context Menu
- **Objective**: Add right-click options for zip/unzip operations
- **Files to modify**: `main.ts`
- **Implementation**:
  - Register file menu events for folders and zip files
  - Add "Zip Folder" option for TFolder objects
  - Add "Unzip Archive" option for .zip/.7z files
  - Integrate with existing archive functions

### Phase 4: Temporary File Cleanup

#### 4.1 Orphaned File Detection and Cleanup
- **Objective**: Add setting and functionality to clean up orphaned temp files
- **Files to modify**: `main.ts`, settings tab
- **Implementation**:
  - Add setting option for automatic cleanup
  - Create function to detect orphaned temporary files
  - Add manual cleanup command
  - Implement automatic cleanup on plugin load

## Viability Assessment

### Technical Feasibility: ✅ HIGH
- All proposed features work within Obsidian's API capabilities
- No external dependencies required beyond existing ones
- Progressive enhancement approach allows incremental implementation

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Phase 1 (Progress)**: Medium complexity - requires careful async/cancellation handling
- **Phase 2 (Deletion)**: Low complexity - mainly improving existing code
- **Phase 3 (Context Menu)**: Medium complexity - requires Obsidian file menu API integration
- **Phase 4 (Cleanup)**: Low complexity - file system operations and settings

### Risk Assessment:
- **Low Risk**: Folder deletion improvements, cleanup functionality
- **Medium Risk**: Progress modal implementation (UI complexity)
- **Medium Risk**: Context menu integration (API compatibility)

### Development Time Estimate:
- Phase 1: 4-6 hours
- Phase 2: 2-3 hours  
- Phase 3: 3-4 hours
- Phase 4: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 11-16 hours

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Progress Indication & Cancellation Support
- [x] Create ProgressModal component
- [x] Implement cancellation token pattern
- [x] Update createArchive with progress callbacks
- [x] Update restoreArchive with progress callbacks
- [x] Test progress indication and cancellation

### Phase 2: Improved Folder Management
- [x] Review deleteFolderSafely implementation

- [x] Test folder deletion scenarios

### Phase 3: Context Menu Integration
- [x] Research Obsidian file menu API
- [x] Implement context menu for folders
- [x] Implement context menu for archives
- [x] Test context menu functionality

### Phase 4: Temporary File Cleanup
- [x] Add cleanup settings option
- [x] Implement orphaned file detection
- [x] Create manual cleanup command
- [x] Add automatic cleanup on load
- [x] Test cleanup functionality

## Next Steps

Starting implementation with Phase 1 (Progress Indication) as it provides the most immediate user value and addresses the primary complaint about operation visibility.

## Implementation Log

*Starting implementation: 2025-08-16 14:03:50*

### Phase 1 Complete: Progress Indication & Cancellation Support
*Completed: 2025-08-16 14:09:13*

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ Created `ProgressModal` component with progress bar, status text, and cancel button
- ✅ Implemented `CancellationToken` class for operation abortion
- ✅ Enhanced `createArchive` function with progress callbacks and cancellation support
- ✅ Enhanced `restoreArchive` function with progress callbacks and cancellation support
- ✅ Updated zip-folder command to use progress modal
- ✅ Updated restore-last-archive command to use progress modal
- ✅ Build successful - no compilation errors

**Files Modified:**
- `src/progress-modal.ts` (new file) - Progress modal and cancellation token implementation
- `src/archive.ts` - Added cancellation token support to createArchive and restoreArchive
- `main.ts` - Integrated progress modals into zip and restore commands

**Technical Details:**
