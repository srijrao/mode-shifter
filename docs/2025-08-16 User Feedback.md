## Overview

This document outlines the user feedback collected for the Mode Shifter plugin, including suggestions for improvements and identified issues.

### Issues with the Plugin

- Users reported that it is hard to understand the progress of the zipping of files, or stopping operations if they take too long. A progress indicator or cancel button would be helpful.
- Users mentioned that the renaming fallback for deletion can ruin the linking and other plugins in the vault. It is preferred to have the folder either keep the same name or be deleted.
- The users wished that the plugin would provide a right click option in the explorer tab to quickly zip folders, or unzip zip/7zip files.
- Users want the option in the settings to delete all the temporary files created by the plugin that don't have a corresponding archive file.
