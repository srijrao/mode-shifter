# Issues

*2025-08-14*

1. The plugin does not delete the original file when creating an archive
2. The plugin creates empty zip files, not containing the files meant to be zipped. 
3. There is no button to unapply the current mode.
4. Only one mode at a time should be enabled
5. The estimation of file size always says zero.
6. The preview always shows nothing for a preview.

No need for the normal mode. 
Please, remove it. Create tests to ensure that these issues are resolved. After tests resolve, npm run build.
