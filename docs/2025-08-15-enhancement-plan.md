# Mode Shifter Enhancement Plan
**Date:** August 15, 2025

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to enhance the Mode Shifter plugin with the following key improvements:

1. Fix modal height to fit content properly
2. Auto-delete archives after successful restoration and verification
3. Add configurable option to remove/keep folders when zipped
4. Add folder group settings with dedicated commands
5. Add unzip command with modal selection

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Code Structure
- **Main Plugin**: `main.ts` - Contains core plugin logic, commands, and settings
- **Archive Module**: `src/archive.ts` - Handles zip creation, verification, and restoration
- **Current Commands**:
  - `zip-folder`: Opens modal to select folder for zipping
  - `archiver-restore-last`: Restores the most recent archive
- **Current Settings**:
  - `archiveFolder`: Where archives are stored
  - `restorePolicy`: How conflicts are handled during restoration

### Current Issues Identified
1. **Modal Height**: Currently fixed at 400px with overflow scroll
2. **Archive Cleanup**: No automatic deletion after successful restoration
3. **Folder Deletion**: No option to delete original folder after zipping
4. **No Group Management**: No way to configure folder groups
5. **Limited Unzip Options**: Only "restore last" command available

## Enhancement Plan

### Phase 1: Modal Height Fix ✅
**Goal**: Make modal height dynamic based on content
**Changes**:
- Modify `FolderSelectModal` to calculate optimal height
- Set reasonable min/max bounds
- Improve visual appearance

### Phase 2: Archive Auto-Deletion ✅
**Goal**: Delete archives after successful restoration
**Changes**:
- Modify restoration logic to include archive deletion
- Add verification step before deletion
- Update settings to control this behavior

### Phase 3: Configurable Folder Deletion ✅
**Goal**: Option to delete original folders after zipping
**Changes**:
- Add `deleteOriginalFolder` setting
- Modify zip command to handle folder deletion
- Ensure proper error handling and rollback

### Phase 4: Folder Groups ✅
**Goal**: Allow users to define groups of folders for batch operations
**Changes**:
- Extend settings interface to include folder groups
- Add group management UI
- Create commands for each group (zip/unzip)
- Update settings tab with group configuration

### Phase 5: Enhanced Unzip Command ✅
**Goal**: Better unzip experience with archive selection
**Changes**:
- Create new unzip command with modal selection
- Show available archives with metadata
- Handle single archive case automatically

## Implementation Details

### Settings Interface Enhancement
```typescript
interface ArchiverSettings {
    archiveFolder: string;
    restorePolicy: RestorePolicy;
    deleteOriginalFolder: boolean;
    deleteArchiveAfterRestore: boolean;
    folderGroups: FolderGroup[];
}

interface FolderGroup {
    name: string;
    folders: string[];
    description?: string;
}
```

### New Commands Structure
- `zip-folder` (existing, enhanced)
- `unzip-archive` (new)
- `archiver-restore-last` (existing, enhanced)
- Dynamic group commands: `zip-group-{name}`, `unzip-group-{name}`

### Modal Improvements
- Dynamic height calculation
- Better visual feedback
- Archive selection with metadata display

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Modal height fixes (UI only)
- Settings additions (backward compatible)

### Medium Risk
- Archive auto-deletion (data loss potential)
- Folder deletion after zipping (data loss potential)

### High Risk
- None identified

### Mitigation Strategies
- Thorough verification before any deletion
- Rollback mechanisms for failed operations
- User confirmation for destructive actions
- Comprehensive error handling

## Success Criteria
1. Modal displays all folders without excessive scrolling
2. Archives are automatically cleaned up after successful restoration
3. Users can choose to keep or remove original folders when zipping
4. Folder groups can be configured and used via dedicated commands
5. Unzip command provides clear archive selection interface
6. All existing functionality continues to work
7. No data loss during normal operations

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 30 minutes (Modal fixes)
- **Phase 2**: 45 minutes (Archive auto-deletion)
- **Phase 3**: 45 minutes (Folder deletion option)
- **Phase 4**: 90 minutes (Folder groups)
- **Phase 5**: 45 minutes (Enhanced unzip)
- **Total Estimated Time**: 4.25 hours
